Removed ShapeExternal from shapeExpr so you can't have EXTERNAL inside an e.g. ShapeAnd

Removed IDs from shapeExprs and created a ShapeDecl:
  id:shapeExprLabel
  abstract:BOOL
  shapeExpr:shapeExpr | ShapeExternal

[Validation Definition](https://shexspec.github.io/spec/#validation) includes [satisfiesDescendant](https://shexspec.github.io/spec/#satisfiesDescendant).

[Semantics](https://shexspec.github.io/spec/#shape-expression-semantics) starts with a calculation of nestedShapes.

[Definition of Satisfies](https://shexspec.github.io/spec/#dfn-satisfies) is followed by an example of inheritance.

Fixed typos in JSG for {Iri,Literal,Language}StemRange and associated ShExC grammar.

Clarified representation of BCP47 language range wildcard ("*").

[5.5.2 Shape Expression Semantics](https://shexspec.github.io/spec/#triple-expressions-semantics) leads with definition of getEffectiveTEs.

[Definition of matchesShape](https://shexspec.github.io/spec/#dfn-matchesshape) introduces (and uses) `slices` returned from `getEffectiveTEs()` with this diff:

``` diff
- * neigh(G, n) can be partitioned into two sets matched and remainder such that matches(matched, expression, m). If expression is absent, remainder = neigh(G, n).
+ * slices is the concatenation of getEffectiveTEs for each label in parentShapeLabels(s).
+ * nCard is the length of slices.
+ * neigh(G, n) can be partitioned into two sets matched and remainder and matched is partitioned into nCard partitions pi such that matches(pi, slicesi, m). If nCard is 0, remainder = neigh(G, n). 
```
